<p> Leo P. Kadanoff revolutionalized our thoughts on critical phenomena through the renormalization approach. He is actually one of the reasons why I am quite fond of UChicago. 
Unfortunately, he passed away in 2015, but you may find his notes on variouts topics including his lecture notes on statistical mechanics 
<a href="/http://jfi.uchicago.edu/~leop/"> here </a> .  </p>
