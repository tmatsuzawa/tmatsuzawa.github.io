One day, someone asked me a question. <br>
"Can you see a flow inside a concave polyhedron like a sphere?"<br>
I responded "Sure, you can. Get a glass sphere, and immerse it in a glycerol. They have the same refractive index so one could see the flow inside the sphere with proper tools."<br>
The person was intrigued by the idea. One could, for example, probe the flow of the mantle of the earth by this technique.<br>
<br>
Yet, scientists often demand more so he asked "can we extend this idea for an arbitrary, concave polyhedron?"<br>
The answer was naturally yes but everyone knows how difficult to morph the glass into a shape that one wants.
<br>
Later, I came up with a solution. One could use 3D printing to print any shape that s/he wants. As for the index-matched fluid, I found one after a few trials and errors.<br>
Below, I immersed a 3D-printed capsule with a hope in the fluid. I agitated the fluid to generate some backgorund flow.<br>
Also, I filled the fluid with fluorescent particles that glow when I shine a laser. <br>
Check the footage below. You can clearly see the flow inside the capsule.

I wonder if such a technique is useful for any research. My first insight is the flow of the mantle, and table-top experements related to the dynamo theory. <br>
<br>
The footage provides food for thought.
