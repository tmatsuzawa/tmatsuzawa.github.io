### Schamatics
- Blender (3D modeling and animation, free)
- Houdini (3D modeling and animation, needs a license)
- Dragonfly (3D scalar field visualization, need a license)
- Graphic (former iDraw)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Biorender (for biological schematics)

### Websites
- Github.io
- Squarespace
- Wix
- Wordpress

### Scheduling tools
- Calendly- If you use Google Calendar, this is a great tool to schedule meetings

### To Do Lists
- Microsoft To Do

### Note taking
- GoodNotes: I use this for my calculations and general note taking. Easy to share. Simple to use. In-person talks go here.
- Microsoft OneNote: I use this for my research notes and to organize my thoughts. Zoom talks go here. This is probably the most comprehensive note taking app but I use GoodNotes for historical reasons.
- Lab notebook: I prefer to take notes on paper in lab because I handle a lot of chemicals and don't want to ruin my iPad.

### Remote desktop
- Chrome Remote Desktop
