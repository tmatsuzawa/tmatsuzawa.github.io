## About

I am a physics Ph.D. candidate at <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Chicago</a>.
I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i>i> from Kalamazoo College, MI, where I pursued physics and chemistry.
I also studied engineering physics at Yokohama National University (YNU) in Japan.

My research interests span the field of soft condensed matter physics.
Soft materials consist of building block that is a lot larger than atoms but a lot smaller than their overall system size.
I am interested in mechanisms how this mesoscopic length/time scale leads to collective behavior of matter.
</br>
Currently, my research focuses on turbulence. </br>
</br>
I was born in Kanagawa, Japan, have lived in Frankfurt, Germany for approximately 4 years during my teenage.
I participated the 36th Harry Messel International Science School at The University of Sydney, Australia, as a national representative.
This experience encouraged me to pursue a career in science and technology.
At YNU, I was involved in Student Formula Japan as a mechanic of a chassis team.
At Kalamazoo College, I conducted research in theoretical condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and
computational neuroscience.
