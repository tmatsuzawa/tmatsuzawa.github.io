By training, I am an experimental physicist with specialization in turbulence and soft condensed matter. 
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in physics at <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Chicago</a>, working in <a href="http://irvinelab.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Professor William Irvine's lab</a>. 
I have a M.S. in physics from the University of Chicago, IL, and a B.A. in physics and chemistry (*summa cum laude*, with distinction) from Kalamazoo College, MI.
My interest lies in 1.understanding collective behavior of matter and 2.data-driven science (mostly machine learning fluid mechanics).
