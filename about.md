By training, I am an experimental physicist with specialization in turbulence and soft condensed matter. 
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in physics at <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Chicago</a>, working in Professor William Irvine's lab. 
I have a M.S. in physics from the University of Chicago, IL, and a B.A. in physics and chemistry (<i>summa cum laude</i>) from Kalamazoo College, MI.
Currently, my primary interest lies in 1.understanding collective behavior of matter and 2.data-driven science.

My current projects include
- turbulence: from controlled generation to decay (experimental, theoretical, numerical, engineering)
- beguiling visualization of scientific data using Houdini (numerical, software)
- machine learning to improve particle image velocimetry (numerical)
- development of a Python package to assess fluid mechanics data (software)

Past projects (just to name a few)
- splashing of low-viscosity fluids (experimental)
- 3D melting of Yukawa system (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (LAMMPS) simulations)
- assessment of muon production rate by several experimental scenarios @Fermilab (numerical)
- modeling synaptic plasticity of Alzheimer's patients (numerical)
- mathematical modeling on vaccine efficacy (mathematical)
- Cowl design and manufacturing, Formula SAE Japan (engineering)

"Iridescent" is the most favorite compliment I have ever received.
I design, build, synthesize, experiment, code, and visualize.

In my free time, I love to read, sketch, cook, and climb. 
Occasionally, I also help children with ASD and their parents.
