Takumi is a Schmidt Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Cornell University in Professor Eric Dufresne's lab.
He has a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago, IL, and a B.A. in physics and chemistry (*summa cum laude*, with distinction) from Kalamazoo College, MI.
During his Ph.D., he worked on turbulence by colliding vortex rings (aka smoke rings), 
demonstrating that turbulence can be localized and manipulated as a state of matter. 
Besides his interests in fluid dynamics, he studies the themodynamics of liquid-liquid phase separation and its roles in biology.
