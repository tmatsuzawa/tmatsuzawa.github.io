"The chamber of secrets has been opened..." 

Chuckle. Look who decided to show up.<br>
This is a space for my personal thoughts. 

The chances are that you partially know me.<br>
Some think that I love to chitchat. Others think I am quiet.<br>
Some think I am awkward/eccentric. Others think I am normal/boring.<br>
Some think I am good with my hands. To others, I am the clumsiest person they have ever met.<br> 

I wonder where I belong in your mind. 
Well, the one within your mind is merely a projection of myself on your mind.

<p>
The chances are that you do not know that I love to check if a random number on the street is a prime. 
I sometimes do that. Why? Just because.<br>
The chances are that I never revealed to you that I have a minor PTSD due to physical and mental abuse from my childhood.<br>
</p>

That is fine. 

Obviously, you within my heart are not a whole you.
That is why I love asking questions about yourself and your daily lives.
