"The chamber of secrets has been opened..." 

Chuckle. Look who decided to show up.<br>
This is a space for my personal thoughts. 

The chances are that you partially know me.<br>
Some think that I love to chitchat. Others think I am quiet.<br>
Some think I am awkward/eccentric. Others think I am normal/boring.<br>
Some think I am good with my hands. To others, I am the clumsiest person they have ever met.<br> 

I wonder where I belong in your mind. 
Well, the one within your mind is merely a projection of myself on your mind.
Similarly, I can only see your shadow one at a time. 
Eventually, many shadows from different light sources give me an idea of who you are.
That is why I love asking questions about you and your daily lives.
