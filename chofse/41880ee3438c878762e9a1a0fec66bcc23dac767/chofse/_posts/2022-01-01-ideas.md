<h4>Ideas:</h4>

<p>Vortex dynamics of symmetric collisions</p>
- point groups
  - [chemical molecules are for inspirations](http://faculty.otterbein.edu/djohnston/sym/gallery/index.html)
  - geometrical symmetries encoded in $\omega$ must be preserved in $u$
- any interesting shapes? a bucky ball? trancated icosahedron?

<p>Flows inside a concave geometry</p>
- i found some tricks for this. -> worked
