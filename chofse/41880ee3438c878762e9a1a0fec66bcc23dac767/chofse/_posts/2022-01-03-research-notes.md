<h3>0. Geometry, topology in vortex dynamics</h3>
... Symmetric collision and platonic solids (worked...)
... what happens for each point group? how much does this duality hold?

<h3>1. Coherent structure manipulation</h3>
For incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence, a flow (state) is characterized by $\epsilon$ and $\nu$ according to K41. 
A revised theory (K62) 


Helical turbulence
Data collection
... injection of angular momentum and helicity 
   ... PIV: 0, Lx, Ly, Lz- this makes sense
   ... STB: 0, Lz, Ly- ok but there are simpler experiments.
   ... param space:


2. Decay of turbulence 



<hr>
Bird's eye view on the problem of turbulence:
1. Dissipative anomaly
2. Self-similarity breaking in turbulence
3. Memory in turbulence
4. Helical decomposition of turbulent cascade


Big ideas in turbulence:
0. Reynolds' observation of laminar-turbulent transition (Re~2000) (19th century)
1. Richardson cascade (1922)
2. Modeling Reynolds stress: heart of CFD (mixing model-> RANS, LES, k-omega, k-epsilon, etc.)
   (Prandtl-> numerical techniques; rise of computers (40s~))
3. Statistical (Russian) school:
3. Duality between a Prey-predator model and meanFlow-fluctuation interaction (Nigel)

Iconic results in turbulence:
1. Law of the wall: 
2. Drag coefficient 

<hr>
Profound problems of hydrodynamics
1. Continuity and smoothness of Navier-Stokes equation or Euler's equation
2. Singularities in the NS or Euler equation
