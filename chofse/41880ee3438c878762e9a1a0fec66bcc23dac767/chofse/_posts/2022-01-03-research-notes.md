0. Geometry, topology in vortex dynamics
... Symmetric collision and platonic solids (worked...)
... what happens for each point group? how much does this duality hold?

1. Coherent structure manipulation
For incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence, a flow (state) is characterized by $\epsilon$ and $\nu$ according to K41. 
A revised theory (K62) 


2. Helical turbulence
Data collection
... injection of angular momentum and helicity 
   ... PIV: 0, Lx, Ly, Lz- this makes sense
   ... STB: 0, Lz, Ly- ok but there are simpler experiments.
   ... param space:


3. Decay of turbulence 



<hr>
Bird's eye view on the problem of turbulence:
1. Dissipative anomaly
2. Self-similarity breaking in turbulence
3. Memory in turbulence
4. Helical decomposition of turbulent cascade


Big ideas in turbulence:
0. Reynolds' observation of laminar-turbulent transition (Re~2000) (19th century)
1. Richardson cascade (1922)
2. Modeling Reynolds stress: heart of CFD (mixing model-> RANS, LES, k-omega, k-epsilon, etc.)
   (Prandtl-> numerical techniques; rise of computers (40s~))
3. Statistical (Russian) school:
3. Duality between a Prey-predator model and meanFlow-fluctuation interaction (Nigel)

Iconic results in turbulence:
1. Law of the wall
2. Drag coefficients- fluctuation-dissipation theorem

<hr>
Profound problems of hydrodynamics
1. Continuity and smoothness of Navier-Stokes equation or Euler's equation
2. Singularities in the NS or Euler equation
