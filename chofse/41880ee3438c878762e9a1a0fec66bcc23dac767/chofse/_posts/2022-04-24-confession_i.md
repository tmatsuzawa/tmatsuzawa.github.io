People only see what they are prepared to see.

There are things I don't actively share because I consider it unnecessary.

Yesterday, I had a nightmare. A few I've loved in my life were yelling at something.
I immediately realized it was a dream but I was paralyzed for a few minutes before I gained a control of my body.
The bed sheet was wet because of my sweat when I finally woke up.

I knew exactly what it was. It was a variant of flashbacks I experience time to time.
Many small events may trigger an unwanted memory to be recalled, then it triggers another one.
One requires tremendous effort to stop this chain of recalling. 

Frankly, I feel slightly ashamed of myslef that this flashback still haunts me at this age.
It gets better every year but is still there. 
One of my friends is an over-fifty-years-old ex-veteran with a similar experience of a child abuse. 
He flinches when someone raises a hand near him, which made me wonder about the long-term effect of the trauma.

The only way I found to cope with this is to forget about it.
A constant recall by the flashbacks is a constant reminder of the past. 
That is why it takes a long time to heal. One should surpress the flashbacks intentionally.

This is why I carefully choose what I see and hear in my life.

Chuckle. Undeniably, this still happens to me even though I almost never bring it up.
I don't need someone's pity. I know how to cope with it.

Like everyone else, I was once a fool, still am to some extent. Once we get to some point, we say that 
we accept our ignorance. Anyway, there was a phase that I really thought that love was a made-up concept 
for humans to work well. A similar thing can be said to my idea of free will. I did not realize for a long time
that people really believed in the idea. Instead, I treated it as a convenient concept to run a society.
Anyway, It took me a while to grasp that some people do love each other. They even say nice things, 
hold hands, hug each other, and even kiss. It was not just a show. For a long time, I didn't know that such an emotion 
existed inside me. My exes were always there to help me realize that. To get there, it must have been easy for them.
They were awefully patient with me. To tell the truth, I must have been able to help them realize something that were 
missing in their past lives. My narcissistic nature would like to think so but there is probably some truth in it.
Now I feel somewhat independent and finally feel what I'd want in my life.

This has been a long introduction to what I wanted to say in this entry.

I don't feel the need to see someone any more. 
To be frank, I feel that that is better for the majority.
I never considered myself as someone you'd dream to date with.
It is better that way. 
Why would you date someone even if you know you cannot provide a good fill for their lives?

So it was a surprise to me to find someone who took no time to hit it off with me.
I rarely make entries these days but I wrote about you on the day I met you.
- unarguably one of the best souls on this planet
- the cutest soul ever existed
etc. The rest may be uncovered in the future if our fates overwrap more.

I never believed in love at first sight. I guess there is always a first in everything.
I am glad it was you.

I refrained myself from making our faint yet sure connection stronger after we met.
My instincts above kicked in, plus we were a thousand (983 according to you) miles away. 
It was also still easy for me to turn back. Just a few nights with a drink. 
My first days in NYC could not have been any better.

If you allow me to share an unorganized part of my life, I just had a breakup with my ex. 
I was also finding a way to cope with harrassment I was experiencing at my work place. 
My ex was also having affairs that I eventually decided not to care. 
Overall, I was happy with what happened to her without me, and I wanted her to stay that way.
I also add that our magics wore off a long time before this inevitable breakup.

A point is that I was also close to some kind of a bottom when I met you in NYC.
It was not fair to try to cling to someone beautiful.
It is not simply how you should interact with someone, especially when she is beautiful.


At this point, I knew how much I'd fall for you.
That was the exact reason why I refrained myself from it.

An year later, we hit it off again. 
Your email to me to catch up was rather surprising as I did not expect you to be patient.
It would have been easy for both of us to treat as if we were just acquaintances.
We just went to a bar and a restaurant after a conference.
Later you told me that you contacted me to test whether we could act like regular acquaintances/friends.
We could have. We just did not especially after we told each other about how we both grew up.

That helped me understand where your thoughtfulness and perceptiveness came from.
It must have been easy to let your experience shape you into a different person.
Instead, you must have taken a courageous path to be the amazing person you are today.
Chuckle. I knew that you were someone beautiful and respectable. (Perhaps, I am being a little narcissistic here.)


What I am actually trying to say is that...
I know what kind of person I'd want in my life now. 
I do not feel the need to be with someone together just to fill in this person's hole.
Not because I would not want to but I know that I'd be worse than an average person.
They are better off with someone else.

Frankly, I've been enjoying the time as a single. 
I do not feel the need to be with someone that I only mildly like anymore.
I miss a buddy to go to a movie with but it might be better this way.
(I tried but again it was more tiring than entertaining.)

I imagine what a normal life would be like. 
What if I take one of the offers from NYC and will be able to remote-work and have a luxuary to visit someone I adore 
for three times a month? It may not be a life someone wants. I don't know. Now I am being selfish.

I guess I am a naive fool after all. 
Like I was in love with this ballerina when I was 16.
Then, I foolishly fell in this potential well without a safety belt.
It was a clever, mutual decision not to pursue it. 
A life comes with lots of flavors. 
This one was a combination of bitterness called foolishiness and sweetness called the love of youth.

This time, I told you that I still have my pickels stuck on the cliff. 
As I look down, I know this well is pretty deep. You are my soulmate after all. 
Yep. A delicate balance.
