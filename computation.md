tflow
---

During my Ph.D. I have developed [tflow](https://github.com/tmatsuzawa/tflow) that collects and analyzes particle velocimetry data.

Houdini for Fluids
---
Houdini (SideFX) is a 3D rendering and simulation software which provides begulling imagery. 
In my research, I use Houdini for fluid visalization. A summary of my journey with Houdini will be posted here.

Python for physicis education
---
Numerics is an essential part of modern science. The use of Python in scientific communities has skyrocketed in the last decade.
This space is a collection of the teaching materials that I created over the years. 
- Some materials are from my assistance to Prof. David Miller's course on [Computational physics (PHYS250)](https://github.com/UChicagoPhysics/PHYS250).
