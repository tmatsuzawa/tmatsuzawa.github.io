tflow
---
During my Ph.D. I have developed [tflow](https://github.com/tmatsuzawa/tflow) that collects and analyzes particle velocimetry data.

            <li>Energy, enstrophy
            </li>
            <li>Reynolds decomposition

            <li>Deformation tensor 
            </li>
        </ul>

    <li>Turbulent flows
        <ul>
            <li>1D energy spectrum

            <li>Structure function
            </li>
            <li>Two-point correlation function
            </li>
            <li>Autocorrelation function

    <li>Potential flows
        <ul>
            <li>Stream function

            <li>Stokes stream function
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
This will be packaged soon. 
(Later, tutorials and images will be posted here.)

Houdini for Fluids
---
Fluid motion is aesthetically pleasing yet often ephemeral. A part of my Ph.D. involved visualizing flows in 3D using [Houdini (SideFX)](https://www.sidefx.com/).
Houdini is a 3D rendering and simulation software which provides begulling imagery. A summary of my journey with Houdini will be posted here.

Python for physics education
---
Numerics is an essential part of modern science. The use of Python in scientific communities has skyrocketed in the last decade.
This space is a collection of the teaching materials that I created over the years. 
- Some materials are from my assistance to Prof. David Miller's course on [Computational physics (PHYS250)](https://github.com/UChicagoPhysics/PHYS250).
