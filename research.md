Unfortunately, many of my ongoing projects are still private because of their nature.

<h3> Building turbulence with vortex rings </h3>

Targeting studies of the mu2e experiment
----------------------------
The mu2 experiments looks for a signature of new physics that breaks the Standard Model (charged lepton flavor violation for experts).
I carried out studies of targeting beam at the Mu2e production target using a software called <a href="https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/e08/papers/mopd017.pdf" target="_blank">G4beamline</a>, through the solenoidal field, both in the current configuration and in proposed upgrade scenarios

Modeling altered synaptic plasticity of Alzheimer's patients
----------------------------
Hebb famously said "Fire together, wire together" to describe learning in our synaptic network. 
If so, what makes Alzheimer's patients dispair their abilities to learn? 
I proposed a multi-scale model that displays disparities in learning. (In collaboration with Peter Erdi.)

Melting of a Yukawa system in 3D
----------------------------
I worked with Professor Jan Tobochnik at Kalamazoo College to make connections between the melting transition and a percolation theory.
