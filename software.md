[comment]: <> (I have also produced a Python package, [spatial-efd]&#40;http://spatial-efd.readthedocs.io&#41; which performs Fourier analysis of shapefile data to allow quantitative analysis of planform morphologies. This code has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software]&#40;http://dx.doi.org/10.21105/joss.00189&#41;)

[comment]: <> (I have released a Google Chrome extension which gives quick access to a proper bibtex file with a DOI for Google Scholar entries. You can get the extension [here]&#40;https://github.com/sgrieve/ScholarDOI&#41;, at present it has not been released on the Chrome Store as it is still a work in progress.)
